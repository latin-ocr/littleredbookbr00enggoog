of this edition of the Little Red Book was to omit all matter not
affecting Bristol directly.¹

From the foregoing resume of the contents oi this interesting
volume it will be apparent how redolent the Little Red Book is oi
the life of the citizens of Bristol in the r4th and 15th centurias, how
from its pages may be gathered a picture of the occupatione and ,
pursuits of the inhabitants, and of the similarity and dissimilarity
between the laults and failings of people of the roth century and of
those who lived from four to five hundred years ago as portrayed by

the ordinances ol the Common Council.

In addition to its historic velue the English documents contained
in this volume will be of great service to the philologiae

The Little Red Book of Bristol is a magnificent specimen ola
class of recorda, many of which through carelessness and want of
appreciation have fallen into decay or are lost It is in a perfect
state of preservation, the paper firm to the touch, the script clear to
the eye, and, unforeseen accident alone excepted, there is no reason
why its future custodian may not find the volume in almost as perfect ‘
a condition five hundred years hence, as it was left by its originator

upwards oi five hundred years ago.
